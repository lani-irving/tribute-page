    <p id="tribute-info">Moths. If you asked your average person about their favourite British wildlife; hedgehogs, badgers, foxes and various birds would likely receive a mention, but it's hard to imagine moths ranking highly on the list. Their apparent desire to fly directly towards my head at any given opportunity has always made me rather skittish, but in recent months the beauty of one particular species has piqued my interest in these curious little creatures. I first became aware of the elephant hawk-moth through images shared in a Wildlife Gardening Facebook group, where their striking pink and olive markings caught my eye. I hadn't realised that such beautiful moths existed, and it has become my as-of-yet unfulfilled mission to find one!<br><br>
      I have already had some success with the caterpillars - they're huge and hard to miss with their distinctive "eye" markings, and it's their trunk-like appearance which gives the species its name. Letting my garden go slightly wild has yielded a mass of rosebay willowherb, a prolific self-seeder which returns every year, and a favoured food plant of the elephant hawk-moth caterpillar. My regular bouts of peering at the willowherb (what my neighbours must think, I'm not quite sure,) paid off this summer when for several evenings in a row I spotted one of these coveted caterpillars chomping away at the foliage. Checking in the mornings, I found that it would devastate a whole plant overnight.<br><br>
      The caterpillar will, by now, have gone into its chrysalis, hiding amonst the leaf litter, where it will spend the winter developing into its impressive adult form. Adult moths emerge between May and July and can measure up to 6cm from wing tip to wing tip. They're most active at dusk, which is when you'll find me lurking amongst the flowers hoping to spot one of these nectar-feeders in action.
